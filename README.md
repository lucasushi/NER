<h3>Useful Info</h3>

- the Beginng of entity and Inside of entity is called BIO notation -- sequence tagging tasks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)

<h3>To-do lists</h3>

- To build a GUI to construct the training and testing dataset (checked)

- To download news data and cut them into sentences

- To familiarize with Recurrent Neural Networks (hold a seminar)

- To carefully study current NER code for English and Hindi (hold a seminar later)

- To design a deep learning model for Chinese NER system

- To test the model on our testing data as well as out-source data

- To design a simple prototype for the NER system

- Further studies: improve the NER system, Company Logo detection project (using CNN), web-crawling plugins, etc.

<h3>Work flow</h3>

Part 1-- data gathering/pre-processing  <-- which is very important too eg, how can i systematically collect data,  maybe writing a web crawling program to crawl forum

Part 2 -- use existing model to get a sense of the "goodness" of the training data

Part 3 -- try to implement the model using tensorflow or if there are one, copy it

Part 4 -- twist the model so that it work well for our problem/data
